  abstract = {Networked structures arise in a wide array of different contexts such
	as technological and transportation infrastructures, social phenomena,
	and biological systems. These highly interconnected systems have
	recently been the focus of a great deal of attention that has uncovered
	and characterized their topological complexity. Along with a complex
	topological structure, real networks display a large heterogeneity
	in the capacity and intensity of the connections. These features,
	however, have mainly not been considered in past studies where links
	are usually represented as binary states, i.e., either present or
	absent. Here, we study the scientific collaboration network and the
	world-wide air-transportation network, which are representative examples
	of social and large infrastructure systems, respectively. In both
	cases it is possible to assign to each edge of the graph a weight
	proportional to the intensity or capacity of the connections among
	the various elements of the network. We define appropriate metrics
	combining weighted and topological observables that enable us to
	characterize the complex statistical properties and heterogeneity
	of the actual strength of edges and vertices. This information allows
	us to investigate the correlations among weighted quantities and
	the underlying topological structure of the network. These results
	provide a better description of the hierarchies and organizational
	principles at the basis of the architecture of weighted networks.

	the establishment of new edges and vertices and the weights' dynamical
	evolution. The model is based on a simple weight-driven dynamics
