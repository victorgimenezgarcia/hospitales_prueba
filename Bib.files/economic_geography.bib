  Abstract                 = {This paper reviews the new economic geography literature, which accounts for the unevendistribution of economic activity across space in terms of a combination of love of varietypreferences, increasing returns to scale and transport costs. After outlining the canonical coreand periphery model, the paper examines the empirical evidence on three of its centralpredictions: the role of market access in deter- mining factor prices, the related home marketeffect in which demand has a more than proportionate effect on production, and the potentialexistence of multiple equilibria. In reviewing the evidence, we highlight issues ofmeasurement and identification, alternative potential explanations, and remaining areas forfurther research.},
