  Abstract                 = {This paper combines data envelopment analysis (DEA) with regression analysis to evaluate the efficiency of central government-owned hospitals in Taiwan over the five fiscal years between 1990 and 1994. Efficiency is first estimated using DEA with the choice of inputs and outputs being specific to hospital operations. A multiple regression model is then employed in which the efficiency score obtained from the DEA computations is used as the dependent variable, and a number of hospital operating characteristics are chosen as the independent variables. The results indicate that the scope of services and proportion of retired veteran patients are negatively and significantly associated with efficiency, whereas occupancy is positively and significantly associated with efficiency. Furthermore, the results also show that hospital efficiency has improved over time during the periods studied and, given the contemporary focus on concerns regarding efficiency in health care, the results provide an indication that inter-temporal efficiency gains are attainable in the health-care sector in anticipation of the implementation of the National Health Insurance Programme (Act). },

This study is relevant to provide an evaluation of the potential effects of recommended and initiated deregulation policies in order to promote market reforms in the context of a European National Health Service. Our goal was reached through three main empirical stages. Firstly, using patient origin data from hospitals in the region of Catalonia in 1990, we estimated geographic hospital markets through the Elzinga?Hogarty approach, based on patient flows. Then we measured the market level of concentration using the Herfindahl?Hirschman index. Secondly, technical and scale efficiency scores for each hospital was obtained specifying a Data Envelopment Analysis. According to the data nearly two-thirds of the hospitals operate under the production frontier with an average efficiency score of 0.841. Finally, the determinants of the efficiency scores were investigated using a censored regression model. Special attention was paid to test the hypothesis that there is an efficiency improvement in more competitive markets. The results suggest that the number of competitors in the market contributes positively to technical efficiency and there is some evidence that the differences in efficiency scores are attributed to several environmental factors such as ownership, market structure and regulation effects.},

  Abstract                 = {The health care sector is one of the fastest growing sectors in the United States. Researchers are interested in conducting studies in the area of health economics in order to propose solutions to curb the rapid increase in health care spending and to improve the efficiency of the health care system in the United States. Specifically, hospital efficiency is one important research area in health economics. In this paper, data envelopment analysis (DEA) is used to assess hospital efficiency. An additive super-efficiency model is presented and applied to a sample of general acute care hospitals in Pennsylvania. In addition to the conventional choice of input and output variables, we include the survival rate as a quality measure of health outcome in the set of output variables. Thus our model takes both the quantity and the quality of the output into account. With the results obtained from our proposed DEA model, inefficiencies can be identified for hospitals to address without sacrificing the quality of care. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

The UK Department of Health has used three cost indices to benchmark NHS hospitals (Trusts). This study uses the same dataset and compares the efficiency rankings from the cost indices with those obtained using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA). The paper concludes that the methods each have particular strengths and weaknesses and potentially measure different aspects of efficiency. Several specifications should be used to develop ranges of inefficiency to act as signalling devices rather than point estimates. It is argued that differences in efficiency scores across different methods may be due to random "noise" and reflect data deficiencies. The conclusions concur with previous findings that there are not truly large efficiency differences between Trusts and savings from bringing up poorer performers would in fact be quite modest.},

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of this study was to perform an interim evaluation of the policy effect of the current reform of Japan's municipal hospitals. We focused on efficiency improvements both within hospitals and within two separate internal hospital organizations. Hospitals have two heterogeneous internal organizations: the medical examination division and administration division. The administration division carries out business management and the medical-examination division provides medical care services. We employed a dynamic-network data envelopment analysis model (DN model) to perform the evaluation. The model makes it possible to simultaneously estimate both the efficiencies of separate organizations and the dynamic changes of the efficiencies. This study is the first empirical application of the DN model in the healthcare field. Results showed that the average overall efficiency obtained with the DN model was 0.854 for 2007. The dynamic change in efficiency scores from 2007 to 2009 was slightly lower. The average efficiency score was 0.862 for 2007 and 0.860 for 2009. The average estimated efficiency of the administration division decreased from 0.867 for 2007 to 0.8508 for 2009. In contrast, the average efficiency of the medical-examination division increased from 0.858 for 2007 to 0.870 for 2009. We were unable to find any significant improvement in efficiency despite the reform policy. Thus, there are no positive policy effects despite the increased financial support from the central government.},

The objective of this paper is to analyse the evolution of efficiency and quality in the Andalusian Hospitals during the years 1997{\textendash}2004 and to study the association between efficiency and quality indicators. Hospital performance is analysed using data envelopment analysis and the Malmquist productivity index. Technical efficiency as well as healthcare quality increased during the analysed period. A weak association between efficiency and quality indicators exists. The results obtained rule out the existence of an efficiency{\textendash}quality trade-off.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper provides the first taxonomy of hospital efficiency studies that uses data envelopment analysis (DEA) and related techniques. We provide a systematic review of 79 such studies published from 1984-2004 that represent 12 countries. Only studies written in English are considered. A cross-national comparison reveals significant differences with respect to important study characteristics such as type of DEA model selected and choice of input and output categories. Compared with US studies, European efforts are more likely to measure allocative rather than technical efficiency, use longitudinal data, and use fewer observations. We take a longitudinal perspective that illustrates the life cycle of this research, as well as its diffusion across disciplines. Our taxonomy can be used by policy makers and researchers to review past, and assemble new, DEA models. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We follow two approaches to quantify movements in productivity: (1) the traditional approach that only considers output and input variables; and (2) a more comprehensive approach that incorporates movements in quality and restricts some achievements, if quality is reduced. On the premise that the indicator for quality (nosocomial infections) is equivalent to a bad output, we explore the characteristics of, and compare the results of, the different technological ways to incorporate quality (good or bad attributes, strong or weak disposability technological assumptions). After discussing the virtues and limitations of the existing possibilities, the paper presents a better formulation that allows the preservation of TQM postulates. The decomposition in the Malmquist productivity index shows an improvement in productivity and a positive technical change, especially when quality is introduced.},

  Abstract                 = {This study proposes a new use of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to measure the operational, environmental and both-unified efficiency measures of US coal-fired power plants. The power plants produce not only desirable outputs (e.g., electricity) but also undesirable outputs (e.g., CO2 and NOx) as a result of their plant operations. A Range-Adjusted Measure (RAM) is used as an original non-radial DEA model. Then, it is reformulated for handling undesirable (bad) outputs. The proposed use of DEA models measures the environmental and unified performance of power plants under two variable alternatives (with and without CO2 emission control) in order to examine both the influence of US Clean Air Act (CAA) on the acid rain causing gases (NOx and SO2) and its extension to the CO2 regulation. This study finds that the acid rain program under the CAA has been effective on the emission control of SO2 and NOx produced at US coal-fired power plants. Moreover, additional regulation on CO2 may enhance their environmental and unified performance. Thus, it is recommended that the US federal and state governments need to expand the legal scope of CAA to the emission control on CO2 because the gas is considered as a main source of global warming and climate change.},
